Hi there 👋
I am a high-achieving, final-year Computer Engineering student (CGPA 9.67) at K. J. Somaiya Institute of Technology, graduating in May 2026. My passion lies in building robust, high-performance systems to solve complex, data-driven problems at the intersection of quantitative finance and artificial intelligence.

🔭 I’m currently working on: A high-performance derivatives pricing engine, featuring a C++ accelerated Monte Carlo simulator for exotic options.

🌱 I’m currently learning: Advanced C++, performance engineering with pybind11, and the architecture of event-driven backtesting systems for algorithmic trading.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Projects involving financial modeling, alpha research, or the development of multi-agent AI systems.

💬 Ask me about: Quantitative finance, derivatives pricing (BSM & Monte Carlo), and building AI/ML systems from the ground up.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or via Email.

💡 Core Competencies
I thrive on turning complex theory into practical, high-performance applications. My core competencies are centered around these key areas:

Quantitative Modeling: I have a deep interest in financial engineering, from pricing complex derivatives using stochastic models to developing and backtesting alpha-generating strategies. I am particularly focused on performance engineering, using C++ to accelerate computationally intensive tasks.

AI & Machine Learning: I am passionate about the entire machine learning lifecycle, from classical statistical modeling and time-series analysis to building cutting-edge, multi-agent AI systems with modern frameworks like LangGraph. My goal is to build not just models, but robust, deployable systems.

🛠️ My Tech Stack
Here are the primary tools and technologies I work with:

Programming Languages: Python, C++, SQL

Quantitative Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, StatsModels, Matplotlib, SciPy

Financial Modeling: Statistical Arbitrage, Time-Series Analysis, Backtesting Frameworks, Monte Carlo Simulation, Options Pricing, Black-Scholes, Fixed Income Analytics

AI Frameworks: LangChain, LangGraph

Developer Tools & Platforms: Git, GitHub, Docker, Streamlit, VS Code, Power BI, RESTful APIs

Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
